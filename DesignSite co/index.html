                Like before starting any other job or project we start with ,why? 
                why do your customers visit your page ? what is it they need
                or are looking for?

            <p2>
               At the begining of the process before we jump in , we 
               work togethere and mockup 1-2 different versions of what
               your website would look like both in mobile version and desktop 
                for you to see. One mockup may have a different type of menu,
                or have buttons from the other or even a complete different color
                palette. We will work with you until you like 100% what you see.
            </p2>

            <p3>
                The development of the website takes 2-4 weeks.

                Whats wrong with CMS(Content managing system)? Simple, performance!
